## DS4Windows
Another fork, again. Based on schmaldeo's fork [release 3.9.9](https://github.com/schmaldeo/DS4Windows/releases)

My goal is to fix simple bugs, add quality of life improvements and **(maybe)** add new--not so advanced--feature/functionality.

## Tips
- enabling **Hide DS4 Controller** in Settings tab enable **Exclusive Mode** insrtead of Shared Mode.
- **FakerInput** enable inputs from gamepad when Task Mangaer is open and UAC popups.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or newer (Thanks Microsoft)
- Microsoft .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime. [x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.0-windows-x64-installer) or [x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.0-windows-x86-installer)
- Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable. [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) or [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
- [ViGEmBus](https://vigem.org/) driver (DS4Windows will install it for you)
- **Sony** DualShock 4 or other supported controller
- Connection method:
  - Micro USB cable
  - [Sony Wireless Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KYVLKG2)
  - Bluetooth 4.0 (via an
  [adapter like this](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166126)
  or built in pc). Only use of Microsoft BT stack is supported. CSR BT stack is
  confirmed to not work with the DS4 even though some CSR adapters work fine
  using Microsoft BT stack. Toshiba's adapters currently do not work.
  *Disabling 'Enable output data' in the controller profile settings might help with latency issues, but will disable lightbar and rumble support.*
- Disable **PlayStation Configuration Support** and
**Xbox Configuration Support** options in Steam
